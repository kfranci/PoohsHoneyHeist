The gameplay is very dynamic and includes the use of collison detection with different objects such as the bees and the honey that pooh
throws as well as the interation with pooh and the bees. There is a life system as well as a score system whcih works with collision detection.
There are also plenty of stylign features that are dynamic and change with gameplay state. This can be seen in the endgame function as well as
the dispStats function. The features that were a bear to program were the collison detection as well as the cooldown for the space bar since 
they had to go through thorough testing and were bugging when the code was being developed. The setInterval functions were also difficult as they 
would not work as intened for a very long time.
